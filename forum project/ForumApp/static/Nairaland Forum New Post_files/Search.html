The Fund’s first close of $30 million occurred in November 2019.<br><br>In partnership with conglomerates in the region, the Fund will develop and operate as many as eight cold chain operations in Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda to reduce post-harvest losses, and the spoilage of processed food and medicines caused by a lack of temperature-controlled solutions.<br><br>Atsuko Toda, the Bank’s Director of Agriculture Finance and Rural Development Department, said “ARCH CCSEAF’s vision to become a regional operator of third-party cold chain logistics services is expected to address the critical issue of post-harvest food loss and food safety hazards in East Africa. Its plan to serve pharmaceutical clients for their storage and distribution of medical supplies is also very timely as the continent continues to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.”<br><br>Traders and retailers represent roughly 40% of the total gross value of Sub-Saharan African value chains, as do farmers, and cold chain solutions are the critical interface between the two parts of the chain. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, globally, roughly 14% of  food losses, excluding the retail stage, occur following harvest and before reaching consumers. This is mainly due to poor cold chain infrastructure.<br><br>The impacts of climate change, including supply chain interruptions and higher temperatures, are expected to exacerbate the problem. Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic has sharpened the need for facilities to store and distribute vaccines and other medicines requiring storage in controlled temperatures.<br><br>The Fund is expected to be a strategic contributor to backward integration of local producers into regional as well as global markets.<br><br>The investment aligns with other Bank initiatives, such as the Covid-19 Response Facility to mitigate the economic and health impacts of the pandemic. The Fund also advances the Bank’s Eastern Africa Regional Integration Strategy 2018-2022, its Climate Change Action Plan, and the High-5 strategic priorities, including Feed Africa.<br><br>The Fund’s manager is ARCH Emerging Markets Partners Limited, a specialist emerging markets investment advisor based in the United Kingdom.<br><br>SOURCE:<a rel="ugc" href="https://brandspurng.com/2021/10/28/development-bank-approves-10-million-equity-investment/">https://brandspurng.com/2021/10/28/development-bank-approves-10-million-equity-investment/</a></div><p class="s"> (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/newpost?topic=6824918&amp;post=107139845">Quote</a>)  (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/makereport?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=107139845&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23107139845">Report</a>)  <b id="lpt107139845">  </b> (<a id="lpl107139845" onclick="like(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=107139845&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23107139845&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unlikepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=107139845&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23107139845&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;lpt107139845&#39;, &#39;lpl107139845&#39;);

Trade and exchange in virtually all major commodities (silver, gold, oil, gas, wheat, sugar, steel, cocoa, coal, corn etc.) are predominantly denominated in US$; hence the currency (and the demand for it) remains central to the modern global economic system. The US is still the biggest economy and single largest national market in the world.<br><br>KEY FACTORS AFFECTING THE OUTLOOK FOR THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE<br><br>With about 9.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in daily crude oil production now, the new US domestic energy reality has profoundly altered currency dynamics globally.<br>US Shale Oil &amp; Gas, coupled with existing strong production bases in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico amongst others, has fundamentally changed the balance of payments and trade against the OPEC and other oil exporters because the US doesn’t need to expend as much in  US$ dollars terms as it did in the past to import crude. This is equally true for other major importers such as the EU and China -2nd biggest economy in the world (whose annual crude oil import bill, for instance, has reduced from an estimated $350b annually to around $212b because of the huge decline in the cost of crude oil within the last four consecutive quarters – with a fiscal savings in foreign outflow of…you guessed right, US$,...to the tune of about $140b in one year.)<br>This changing market structure as well as on-going Geopolitics has consequently impacted upon the market prices for all blends of exported crude including Nigeria’s Qua Iboe and Bonny Light (which refiners often buy because of the low sulphur content in order to be blended with other heavier crude blends such as Iran Heavy, Mexican Isthmus etc. - though not for such exclusively.).<br> Led by the Saudis and the other Gulf Arab producers, OPEC is playing a long-game. The calculation is that the only way to permanently address and perhaps reverse OPEC’s declining share of total global crude production (and sales), is to discourage further investment in additional production capacity (a glut spurred on by then record crude prices) particularly in the non-OPEC sphere – by depressing market prices and forcing high-cost producers out. With about $800b in external foreign currency reserves, the Saudis can afford to wait out the shake-out. As well as UAE, Kuwait and Qatar, they also have US$ Trillions in Sovereign Wealth Funds, first-class (existing) physical infrastructure and relatively manageable population sizes. These GCC states control the bulk of OPEC quotas; therefore one can say they call the ‘shots’.<br> Hence, it is our considered judgment (on basis of an analysis of the evidence) that the outlook for the price per barrel of crude oil is likely to remain at best uncertain and the chances of experiencing $100 Oil in the market any time soon remaining remote. With much more Iranian production coming on stream (even Libyan following recent efforts to reconcile rival factional governments) and buyers already buying less, not more, of Nigerian Crude (reflected in foreign currency revenue terms and also in terms of volume as our recent unsold shipments as shown), net sovereign foreign exchange earnings would likely stagnate or even decline.<br> The weakness in the Naira therefore in part derives from such declining or flat forex earnings as much as it does from the weakness of, and funding deficit in, the local productive sector – necessitating the excessive need to import.  <br> Were Nigeria to have very robust sovereign savings and foreign reserves like others in the OPEC cartel and also the likes of Norway, Alberta (Canada), Russia (we don’t… even if the volume of our cumulative earnings easily suggests we should); and also not be so import-reliant and in the habit of expending on average 3% of GDP or now close to N1.5 Trillion annually to service debt mostly spent on servicing an inefficient bureaucracy and unsustainable fuel subsidy (most of which thankfully is domestic debt; which nonetheless effectively prices-and-crowds out more-efficient private sector borrowing), the Central Bank of Nigeria would not have reportedly needed to spend about $26.6m daily, at a point, defending the value of Naira in the forex market and thus further deplete our external reserves.<br> It is the level of other countries’ demand for our products and services (hence implicitly demand for our currency) vis-à-vis the level of our demand for other nations’ products and services (hence our derived demand for their currency or usually the US$); that simplistically speaking, along with the fiscal health of each respective public treasury that determines the exchange rate.<br> This informed interplay of demand and supply; not monetary policy in of itself , nor psychological thresholds, regulatory directives and/or preferences; ultimately determines the rate at which currencies exchange on a day-to-day basis ceteris paribus.<br> As our population and development aspirations grows, we are importing more but receiving less for our own exports because of declining oil revenue receipts and systemic leakages across the Oil &amp; Gas value-chain and because our non-oil exports, whilst growing impressively, isn’t of such a significant enough quantum yet in proportion to our needs, to positively reflect on the strength of the domestic unit a.k.a. local currency. Unless an unlikely major geopolitical event (such as a direct Saudi-Iran military confrontation beyond mere animosity and proxy conflicts for instance; yet another ‘Ukraine’ in Europe or armed conflict over the South-China Sea) occurs and subsists over a lengthy period, the market fundamentals (especially being reportedly over-supplied by over 3.5m bpd) do not support an optimistic outlook for the price of Bonny Light.<br> One legacy of the last Administration was the Agricultural Transformation Agenda which thankfully resulted manifest reduction in food import volume and food import bill because of a huge jump in annual tonnage of local food production over the past 4 farming seasons thus creating an effective ‘fiscal buffer’; otherwise the situation with domestic price inflation (c9.2%) would have been even worse particularly if the dire fuel subsidy imbroglio continues. We nonetheless note with caution the continuing impact of the security situation in the North-East on domestic food production.<br> Sadly, most State Governments are already over-borrowed; and the resultant debt service obligation, being a first-line charge on their declining Federation Account earnings, significantly reduces their capacity to bear basic obligations much less fund a Development Agenda (where one actually exists!). While this liquidity deficit might somewhat inadvertently help tame some inflation and importation, it is a systemic decline that shows an absence of buffers and scenario planning which negatively impacts on people’s lives and the developmental prospects of the nation – not to mention its undesirable potential to ignite civil disorder which is one thing our security situation at the moment certainly can afford to do without.                 <br>It is therefore important to situate the outlook for domestic inflation and the currency exchange rate within the context of these existing macro-economic, structural and socio-political realities.                     <br><br><span class="highlight">greenfield</span> ADVISORS LIMITED’S EXCHANGE RATE ANALYSIS &amp; FORECASTS FOR YEAR-END 2015<br><br>It is salutary to see the CBN so gallantly defend the Naira (amongst its other roles) for this long. We however believe it cannot continue to allow reserve depletion indefinitely; and that its decision to officially bar 41 imported commodities from the Official Inter-Bank Forex Market portends significant inflationary consequences.<br><br>This weighty decision, the latest in a series of policy initiatives aimed at addressing the Naira’s decline some of which have prompted some market participants to essentially accuse the CBN of ‘non-transparency in price determination’, while not entirely surprising is yet paradoxical given the fact that the Apex Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (especially Governor Godwin Emefiele, CON) has always maintained that the Parallel Market is inconsequential; accounts for only a small share of total forex transactions in Nigeria and is in any case merely a market for unsanctioned transactions.<br><br>Without delving into the debate on the rationale and the timing, one nonetheless recognises the effect of such measure on domestic price inflation and the Naira in the short and medium term. Coupled with the situation with petroleum product imports; forcing buyers of iron rods, food products etc. to procure dollars from the so-called ‘Black Market’ will likely induce the US Dollar to further strengthen against the Naira (in the near to medium term) even as the US Fed imminently unwinds Quantitative Easing. In point of fact, the relative present scarcity of dollars reported in the Parallel or Black Market is as a result of the general expectation among traders that the rate will continue to trend higher.<br><br>Should this inflationary scenario play itself out, the CBN might be find itself with no option but to further devalue the currency for the sake of price stability and reserve preservation, and perhaps reverse its stance by re-admitting some excluded imported items into the Official market in an eventual effort to stabilise the exchange rate and in an attempt to harmonise rates between Official and Parallel markets (circumstances permitting).<br><br>Long-term, our domestic output and non-oil exports must expand (fast!) and we must moderate our reliance on importation and possibly bring it to a bearable minimum. This imperative however faces strong headwinds such as; the near absence or inadequate supply and/or quality of immediate locally-made substitutes, the government out-competing with producers/ borrowers for loanable funds by paying double-digit interest on tax-free bonds and treasury bills; uncompetitive physical and regulatory environment as well as a disenabling infrastructure deficit.<br><br>Also If domestic industry and entrepreneurs’ can’t get ample access to affordable financing, job creation would remain weak; hence total domestic production is likely to remain low, further inducing increased importation and inflation - which negatively impacts on exchange rate stability and balance of payments.<br><br>It amounts to a case of what Chief Kola Jamode (an industrialist and former Minister of Commerce &amp; Industry) describes as "exporting jobs and importing poverty".<br><br>These aforementioned issues remain the key priorities which the National Economic Management Team must urgently address its efforts to - in order to sustainably develop the economy thus effectively strengthening the Naira's value long-term (against all currencies, not just the Dollar).</div><p class="s"> (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/newpost?topic=6816382&amp;post=106980988">Quote</a>)  (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/makereport?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106980988&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106980988">Report</a>)  <b id="lpt106980988">  </b> (<a id="lpl106980988" onclick="like(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106980988&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106980988&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unlikepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106980988&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106980988&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;lpt106980988&#39;, &#39;lpl106980988&#39;); return false;" href="https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106980988&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106980988">Like</a>)<b id="shb106980988"></b> (<a id="sh106980988" onclick="share(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_share?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106980988&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106980988&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unshare?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106980988&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106980988&#39;, &#39;sh106980988&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;shb106980988&#39;); return false;" href="https://www.nairaland.com/do_share?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106980988&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106980988">Share</a>)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="106454806"></a><a name="msg106454806"></a><a name="6786385.13"></a><img src="./Search_files/xx.gif">  <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/politics">Politics</a> / <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/6786385/real-reason-want-biafra#106454806">Re: The REAL Reason They Want 'Biafra'</a> by <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/fallenshithole" class="user">FallenShitHole</a>: <span class="s"><b>11:19pm</b> On <b>Oct 04</b></span></td></tr><tr><td id="pb106454806" class="l w pd"><div class="narrow"><b>Southeast Has The Highest Gas Reserve In Africa.</b><br><br>According to department of petroleum resources, Nigeria has about 202 million trillion cubic fit (TCF) natural gas reserve and about 70% are domacile in south east.

class="narrow"><blockquote>President Muhammadu Buhari has returned to Abuja after a loaded weeklong engagements at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, United States of America.<br><br><b>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports the Nigerian leader came back with a special request from the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, to help in restoring socio-political order in troubled West African countries.</b><br><br>Guterres, who commended Buhari for his leadership roles in Africa as well as stabilisation of the West African sub-region, was speaking during an audience with the Nigerian leader at the sidelines of the 76th Session of the UNGA.<br><br>The UN scribe observed that Africa, especially West Africa, was generally seen as an ocean of stability and good governance, but was deeply concerned at recent reversal of fortunes in democratic rule in some parts of the West African sub-region with coups overturning elected institutions.<br><br><b>He, therefore, urged Buhari to continue to show leadership as he looked up to Nigeria to help stabilise the sub-region in terms of democracy and good governance.</b><br><br>On terrorism, the secretary general commended the efforts of Nigeria on this global phenomenon.<br><br>Guterres assured the Nigerian leader of the UN’s continued support in her efforts to address the prevailing security and humanitarian challenges that had arisen especially with the Internally Displaced Persons.<br><br>The president applauded Gutterres for his global leadership and the success of the 76th Session.<br><br>On Sept. 22, Buhari participated via a video message in the hybrid High-Level event, tagged “Transformative Actions for Nature and People”, on the margins of the UNGA.<br><br>He revealed that the Federal Government had initiated some specific actions to tackle and reverse the severe trend of biodiversity loss, which affects the whole world.<br><br>Also in New York, on Sept. 23, Buhari at the Food Systems Summit, as part of the High Level meetings of the 76th Session of UNGA, reaffirmed the commitment of the federal government to attain national food security.<br><br>He said that Nigeria had developed a “food system focused development agenda that prioritises healthy diets and affordable nutrition, inclusive, efficient, resilient and sustainable, which will contribute to rebuilding our economy, create jobs and spur growth across sectors, while sustaining our ecosystems”.<br><br>The Nigerian leader, who addressed the 76th Session of the UN Assembly on Sept. 24, raised alarm over the recent trend of the unconstitutional takeover of power in some West African countries, urging world leaders to reject such illegal acts.<br><br>According to Buhari, such unconstitutional takeovers, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, should not be tolerated by the international community.<br><br>The president warned that the democratic gains of the past decades in West Africa ‘‘are now being eroded’’ due to these negative trends.<br><br>He urged G20 countries to extend its debt suspension initiatives to all developing countries, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges.<br><br>The president also called for outright debt cancellation for countries facing the most severe challenges occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>The speech also touched on the efforts of his administration on anti-corruption, debt suspension, international trade, UN Security Council Reform, Palestinian Question and racial discrimination, among others.<br><br>While still in New York, Buhari reiterated the determination of his administration to work on an ambitious Energy Plan towards reducing the energy shortcomings by year 2030.<br><br>He spoke in line with Nigeria’s role as a Global Theme Champion for the Energy Transition, theme of the High-Level Dialogue on Energy on the sidelines of the 76th UNGA.<br><br>The president said: “Nigeria’s commitment to a just transition is reflected in our ambitious Energy Compact, which includes the Government’s flagship project to electrify 5 million households and 20 million people using decentralised solar energy solutions.”<br><br>Also on the sidelines of the 76th UNGA, Buhari engaged some world leaders, including the President of Burundi; Amb. Linda Thomas-<span class="highlight">greenfield</span>, the Permanent Representative of America to the United Nations; Prime Minister of Netherlands, Mark Rutte; as well as Queen of the Netherlands, Her Majesty, Maxima Zorreguieta, in bilateral talks.<br><br>NAN also reports that the presidential aircraft which departed JFK International Airport in New York on Saturday at about 11.40 a.m local time, landed at the presidential wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on Sunday at 5.20 a.m. </blockquote><br><a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/09/breaking-buhari-returns-to-abuja-with-special-assignment-from-world-body/amp/?utm_source=&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;__twitter_impression=true">https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/09/breaking-buhari-returns-to-abuja-with-special-assignment-from-world-body/amp/?utm_source=&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;__twitter_impression=true</a></div><p class="s"> (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/newpost?topic=6772234&amp;post=106181486">Quote</a>)  (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/makereport?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106181486&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106181486">Report</a>)  <b id="lpt106181486">8 Likes </b> (<a id="lpl106181486" onclick="like(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106181486&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106181486&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unlikepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106181486&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106181486&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;lpt106181486&#39;, &#39;lpl106181486&#39;); return false;" href="https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106181486&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106181486">Like</a>)<b id="shb106181486"> 2 Shares</b> (<a id="sh106181486" onclick="share(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_share?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106181486&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106181486&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unshare?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106181486&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106181486&#39;, &#39;sh106181486&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;shb106181486&#39;); return false;" href="https://www.nairaland.com/do_share?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=106181486&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23106181486">Share</a>)</p><p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="./Search_files/14286023_b41_webp_webpf88377ec6c6a7a822cc0f9cc7f763434"> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="106036095"></a><a name="msg106036095"></a><a name="6763782.112"></a><img src="./Search_files/xx.gif">  <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/politics">Politics</a> / <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/6763782/edwin-clark-writes-buhari-rejects/3#106036095">Re: Edwin Clark Writes Buhari, Rejects Proposed Naval Base Project In Kano</a> by <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/gireiboy" class="user">Gireiboy</a>(<span class="m">m</span>): <span class="s"><b>3:08pm</b> On <b>Sep 21</b></span></td></tr><tr><td id="pb106036095" class="l w pd"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="https://www.nairaland.com/post/106035337"><b>Truthissupreme</b></a>:<br>una go private school reach south?<br><br>Na south dey even bring private schools like <span class="highlight">greenfield</span> University come north<br><br>Does that even change the fact that the education standard of both regions going to public schools in the north it is 2/200<br><br>It's not stale o, joke on your almajiris </blockquote>Every sensible Nigerian knows most of you guys are emotional dundees, illogical and frankly very stupid, i mean you guys brazenly peddle lies on cyberspace and for what! just to win a futile argument.

In the case of Jos, there are few records and oral histories that talk about the defeat of the Emir Yakubu Bauchi and his Jihadist soldiers by a combined effort of Indigenous warriors of the Anaguta, Berom and Amo, when they (the jihadists) invaded the present day Jos area of the Plateau around the late 1800s.<br><br>From the early 1900s, Kaduna started growing as an urban center because it was made the capital of the new Northern protectorate (subsequently Northern region) by the British, due to it's centralized location and easy navigation through the Kaduna river which drains directly into the Niger river.<br>Jos on the other hand began to grow due to the lucrative Tin mining industry that begun in the early 1900s.<br>Other towns like Kafanchan also grew because it was a very important railway junction that linked different parts of Nigeria, at a time when railway was the most common means of transportation.<br><br>These cities/towns started attracting people from all over Nigeria. Yorubas, Igbos, Hausas, Kanuris, Fulanis, Urhobos, Ibibios, Edos, Idomas, Igalas, Ebiras, Nupes, e.t.c came in large numbers.<br>In fact, at the time of the Independence of Nigeria, settlers and foreigners outnumbered the Indigenous people in both Kaduna and Jos towns.<br><br>Unlike in Kaduna city where the evolving settlements were very mixed in nature, with every ethnicity and religion being present in almost every neighborhood, Jos had a very different settlement pattern per neighborhood.<br>In the case of Jos, this happened because the labourers of the Tin mines formed their own ethnic communities and were sometimes settled by the British in different neighborhoods based on their arrivals.<br>It is a known fact that during the colonial era, the Indigenous people of the Jos-Plateau did not show much enthusiasm or interests in working on these Tin mines, hence foreign labourers had to be brought in by the British from other parts of colonial Nigeria.<br><br>For example, most of the Yorubas who arrived Jos in the early 1900s were settled around Kasuwan dare/Rikkos and Nasarawa axis to the Southeast of Jos city center. The Hausas, Fulanis, Kanuris and other core-northern muslim people were settled along the Bauchi road to the northwest of the city center, while the Igbos were settled around Tafawa Balewa/Apata areas to the Southwest of Jos city center.<br>Till today, most of these communities are still found in their majority in these areas in Jos.<br><br>The numbers of we the Plateau and Southern Kaduna Indigenous people started growing in Kaduna and Jos significantly after the colonial era especially when the first 12 states were created in the late 60s after the civil war.<br>At that time, thanks to the education that came with the missionaries, we had enough educated people to start filling up the new administrative positions that came with the new states, local government areas, districts e.t.c.<br><br>These cities/towns within Plateau and Southern Kaduna kept growing in large numbers and cosmopolitanism until series of Ethno-religious crisis started from the late 80s in Kafanchan and reached it's peak from 2000 - 2010 within Jos and Kaduna cities.<br>These conflicts (which I prefer to call CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS) ended up creating irreversible ethno-religious partitions between both Kaduna and Jos cities and elsewhere within other parts of the country.<br><br>Most Yorubas, Igbos, other Southern Nigerians and people from other parts of the Middlebelt region like Benue/ Kogi who have lived and are still living in these areas can truthfully and sincerely testify of the extreme liberal and kind nature of our people, from earlier times and even till date.<br><br>Before the conflicts began, and even till now, our people who are Indigenous to the areas around these cities were so generous to a fault.<br>They welcomed the ever expanding influx of foreigners into these cities/towns with so much kindess. Landed properties were given to these settlers at giveaway prices and many times even free of charge.<br>Food was insanely cheap and sometimes even given free of charge. This kindness even extended to our fathers freely giving their daughters for marriage to these settlers all in a bid to cement peaceful and harmonious living.<br>This kindness and simplicity on the part of our people made both cities continue to grow rapidly even after Independence when Kaduna ceased being regional capital and when Tin mining activities on the Jos Plateau fell.<br><br>In the case of Kaduna city with the Gbagyis, the 'kindness and simplicity' even became an object of ridicule and a stereotype till the late 90s.<br>People often said that Gbagyi Indigenes sold and gave away their lands in Kaduna to settlers while they relocated further into the interior villages as the cities expanded.<br>Now, this could be true, albeit not in the proportions of the stereotypes.<br>This is because most of we the Indigenous people of the PLATEAU- GURARA- GONGOLA area have never been a centralized urban loving and trading people. Our lives are tied to and revolve around our farmlands.<br>[This is with the exception of some of the Jukunoid groups and some other neighbouring groups around Taraba and the Upper Benue (Nasarawa and Plateau south) who developed an urban culture during the days of KWARARAFA]<br><br>Just as the ridicule with the Indigenous Gbagyi people of Kaduna city, more and different forms of ridicule and mockery have been thrown at us by people we accommodated.

They also said that top American officials had tried, unsuccessfully, to schedule meetings with their French counterparts before news of the deal leaked in the Australian and American press.<br><br>In a briefing with reporters on Friday before the recall announcement by the French government, Linda Thomas-<span class="highlight">greenfield</span>, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, downplayed the damage to the relationship between the two countries.<br><br>“As the president said, we cooperate closely with France on shared priorities both in the Indo-Pacific region and we’ll continue to do so here in the Security Council,” she said. “Good friends have disagreements, but that’s the nature of friendship and that’s — because you’re friends, you can have disagreement and continue to work on those areas of cooperation.”<br><br>She added: “We will continue to work with our French colleagues on areas of cooperation and address any tensions in our relationship, but we don’t see those tensions changing the nature of our friendship.”<br><br>But the move by the French to recall their ambassador to the United States, Philippe Étienne, in order to consult with other officials about the American decision is the kind of step usually taken to punish another country, signaling a bad relationship.<br><br>In March of this year, Russia recalled its ambassador to the United States after Mr. Biden said in an interview that President Vladimir V. Putin would “pay a price” for interference in the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Biden also agreed that Mr. Putin was a “killer.”<br><br>Biden administration officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the French decision to recall their ambassador.</blockquote><br><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/france-ambassador-recall-us-australia.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/france-ambassador-recall-us-australia.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes</a></div><p class="s"> (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/newpost?topic=6758986&amp;post=105921264">Quote</a>)  (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/makereport?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105921264&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105921264">Report</a>)  <b id="lpt105921264">1 Like </b> (<a id="lpl105921264" onclick="like(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105921264&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105921264&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unlikepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105921264&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105921264&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;lpt105921264&#39;, &#39;lpl105921264&#39;);

Prior to this article, another similar article on the extermination of Northern Nigeria's Christians was posted two years ago on the Spectator (<a rel="ugc" href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/abandoned-to-their-fate">https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/abandoned-to-their-fate</a>). Not long ago, more than 120 students from Bethel Baptist School were kidnapped, all of whom are Christians, and less than 30 have been released. Some of the girls (max age is 17) were raped and boys tortured. Before that, students from <span class="highlight">greenfield</span> University and the School of Forestry, both in Southern Kaduna (a Christian dominated area), were kidnapped. Some were slaughtered, others are still in captivity and some were released after parents paid ransoms close to N200M.<br><br>Today, farmlands in Christian dominated Plateau are ransacked, women raped and men killed. Indigenous Christians in Bauchi are made to live under Sharia Law while their counterparts in Gombe are made to live under a Muslim Emirate even though they are not Muslims. What about their traditional leaders? They are kidnapped and later killed ditto for their religious clerics. The pastor in Niger who was killed and the other in Abuja who was kidnapped with his children and later killed. I wager that those kids will be enslaved and brainwashed.<br><br>While these go on unhindered, Christian leaders in Southern Nigeria are mysteriously mute and go about raising tithes, building huge church edifices, nose-poking into elaborate burial events and sacking "unproductive pastors". So-called intellectuals have kept mute and parry facts when presented (as seen on this thread).<br><br>Unfortunately, due to these events, the elimination of Northern Nigeria's Christians continues.</blockquote><br><br>Going through the thread, I did not see the usual "peaceful Muslims" aka Legalwolf, Mycoin and Yoruba Muslims. I am pretty sure that most Christians who criticise El-rufai on this thread for his genocidal atrocities are not Yorubas but of other ethnic groups. I say this because from observations, Yoruba Christians have been mysteriously silent or lend backing to Islamists who are maiming fellow Christians in the north. Two notable examples are: Enoch Adeboye of the RCCG who praised El-Rufai as a "kind and caring man" because same jihadist assisted Adeboye in the release of kidnapped RCCG members. Secondly, Iyin Aboyeji - a popular tech entrepreneur and son of the general overseer of Foursquare Gospel Chruch - categorised the continuous and targeted killings of Southern Kaduna's indigenes as "little genocides". If you notice, these are popular and rich Yoruba Christians who rather than speak against the genocide meted against Northern Nigeria's Christians lend their support to the chief jihadist perpetrating these atrocities. <br><br>Regarding the death of the pastor, this should be the fifth or sixth pastor in Northern Nigeria who has been brutally murdered that I know of. This excludes others I do not know about and those who don't get to the news at all. What we are seeing is the continuous, systematic and strategic Islamisation and Fulanisation of Nigeria. <br><br>May his soul rest in peace.</div><p class="s"> (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/newpost?topic=6750471&amp;post=105790791">Quote</a>)  (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/makereport?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105790791&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105790791">Report</a>)  <b id="lpt105790791">  </b> (<a id="lpl105790791" onclick="like(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105790791&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105790791&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unlikepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105790791&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105790791&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;lpt105790791&#39;, &#39;lpl105790791&#39;); return false;" href="https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105790791&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105790791">Like</a>)<b id="shb105790791"></b> (<a id="sh105790791" onclick="share(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_share?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105790791&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105790791&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unshare?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105790791&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105790791&#39;, &#39;sh105790791&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;shb105790791&#39;); return false;" href="https://www.nairaland.com/do_share?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105790791&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105790791">Share</a>)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="105617056"></a><a name="msg105617056"></a><a name="6741681.133"></a><img src="./Search_files/xx.gif">  <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/politics">Politics</a> / <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/6741681/peter-obi-donates-n100-million/4#105617056">Re: Peter Obi Donates N100 Million To Shanahan Specialist Hospital, Nsukka (picture)</a> by <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/nzeobi" class="user" title="Location: lagos">nzeobi</a>(<span class="m">m</span>): <span class="s"><b>5:07pm</b> On <b>Sep 08</b></span></td></tr><tr><td id="pb105617056" class="l w pd"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="https://www.nairaland.com/post/105612521"><b>IPIGSRSHALLOW</b></a>:<br><br><br>Peter Obi, vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has explained why he invested $30million of Anambra State funds in a company owned by his family.<br><br>He stated this in response to a question by Kadaria Ahmed, host of ‘The Candidates’, a presidential town hall co-production between Daria Media and the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), with support from the MacArthur Foundation, held in Abuja on Wednesday.<br><br>He claimed that the company belonged to his parents, and he had no dealings in it after he became a public officer.<br><br>His words: “I brought International Breweries into Nigeria and as a Governor of a state, they built a <span class="highlight">greenfield</span> facility in the state and they came to me and said ‘as our partner, we want you to own 15 per cent of this company’, and I said to them ‘No, right now, I am the Governor of a state.

That has not helped, in fact, it has made our people lazy.<br><br>“Against this differential JAMB and FG (Federal Government) scores, I think people should be encouraged to work hard and compete and we are prepared to make our children in Kaduna State to be competitive, not only in the state but globally.<br><br>“The schools are closed now because, on the advice of security agencies, they need a couple of months to undertake massive security operations. They are doing that. We are confident that from the next two weeks, we would start the gradual reopening of schools.<br><br>“We have moved many of our students in rural areas that we are not sure we can protect to urban schools, thereby increasing the congestion in urban schools that we can protect.”<br><br>“The continuous closure of schools is exactly what bandits and Boko Haram want and we are not going to let them win but we must put the safety of our children and teachers first,” the governor noted, adding that the gradual reopening of schools would commence soon.<br><br><b>‘Kaduna has attracted $3bn investments despite banditry’</b><br><br>Furthermore, the governor said that the state generated over $3bn foreign and local investments in the last two years despite the menace of banditry.<br><br>According to him, the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies are overwhelmed, hence, the need to train hundreds of vigilantes who will bear arms and confront the marauders who operate from the forests of Kaduna.<br><br>This banditry is essentially a rural phenomenon but it has moved to the urban areas,” the governor lamented.<br><br>He said that when the menace of banditry started in the state about three years ago, “it was essentially a rural phenomenon and that has not affected our ability to attract investment in the state”.<br><br>“In the last two years, we’ve attracted more than $2bn, close to $3bn of foreign and domestic investments into the state.<br><br>“We’ve also engaged in massive infrastructure across the state, everywhere,” el-Rufai explained.<br><br><b>525 killed, 1,723 kidnapped in six months</b><br><br>Kaduna has perhaps been the worst hit by the nefarious activities of bandits and kidnappers in recent times in spite of the heavy presence of military formations and institutions present in the state.<br><br>The military has no fewer than six military formations in the city. The military formations include Jaji Military Cantonment; 1 Mech. Division Headquarters, Nigerian Army, Kaduna; New Barracks, otherwise known as ‘Kotoko’ Barracks; Old Site of the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna; Kalanpazi Barracks (Artillery Regiment) and the Nigerian Air Force Base.<br><br>But according to the official statistics by Governor Nasir El-Rufai administration, the vicious marauders killed at least 525 innocent lives, kidnapped 1,723 between January and June 2021.<br><br><b>Serial abductions</b><br><br>On July 24, marauders invaded the country’s foremost military institution, the Nigerian Defence Academy, Afaka, Kaduna, killing two officers and abducting one.<br><br>The NDA campus is opposite the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka where bandits abducted 39 students on March 11, 2021.

According to the information, Nigerians have paid out billions to kidnappers and bandits in different areas of the country. Sunday Telegraph investigations revealed that <b>kidnappers and bandits made over N20 billion in 500 attacks they carried out in two years from January 2019 to May 2020.</b><br><br><b>This is up from the N9 billion which they made in nine months between June 2011 and March 2012.</b> A survey by S B Morgan recently said families of victims and government paid N9 billion. From the North to the South and the East to the West, kidnappers are emboldened daily to carry out their nefarious activities.<br><br>It is said that <b>currently, Nigeria has the highest rate of kidnap-forransom cases besides Venezuela, Mexico, Yemen, Syria, the Philippines, Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia.</b> Experts attributed this to the involvement of organised violent groups, such as militants, bandits and Boko Haram insurgents, who use abduction as the oxygen of their insurgency. They engage in single or group abduction as a means of generating funds for their activities.<br><br>Recall that families of the recently released students of the <span class="highlight">greenfield</span> University said they parted with N280 million to secure the release of 14 students who were kidnapped along with nine others on April 14, 2021. In addition, they also gave eight motorcycles were to the abductors who had demanded for 10 and the sum of N500 million as ransom. Currently families of over 130 students of an Islamiya School in Tegina, Niger State , are running from pillar to post in order to raise the ransom which the kidnappers of the pupils who are between the ages of four years and 10 years are demanding for.<br><br>Initially, they asked for N105 million but the parents said they were able to rake in N11 million, but this only irked the abductors to increase the ransom to N200 million. President, Southern Kaduna People’s Union (SOKAPU), Jonathan Asake, early in the year told a bewildered nation that the members of his community paid N900 million as ransom to abductors across the 12 local government areas in their locality. This, he said, has continued to impoverish them as they can no longer go their farms. He said: “Our poor, vulnerable people paid over N900m as ransom to criminals in 2020.<br><br><br>This is a minimal and conservative estimate. These are cases reported to us. There is a particular point between Kafanchan and Kwoi which came up recently and over N60m was paid there in less than two months. Our people are being impoverished every day by kidnapping and abductions.” There are fears that the figures may be more than this as there have been more cases of abduction after then. For instance, 65 people were kidnapped on the night of 22 April, 2021 in Adara. Ten of them were able to escape.<br><br>For this the abductors demanded for a sum of N350 million. Also , one time Super Eagles Head Coach Samson Siasia’s mother Madam Beauty Ogere, who spent 10 weeks in the den of her abductors, regained her freedom after the family parted with N15million. After the release of over 300 students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State, who were abducted on December 11, 2020, the federal and Katsina State governments denied paying ransom. However, students and abductors involved in what was dubbed Kankara abduction contradicted the official denials.<br><br>Reports had it that Katsina State government paid N30million to secure their release. Over N200m ransom paid in Ekiti Although, it is difficult to say the exact amount that has been paid in ransom in Ekiti, but an estimate families of victims of kidnapping which has been on the rise in the state since 2019, have paid, will be not less than N200 million. In early 2019, two staff of Emure Local Government Area, simply identified as Pastor Onaade, an accountant and Dr. Fasina who headed the Primary Health Care Centre, were kidnapped. Their abductors demanded the sum of N10 million for each of them from their families. They were released one week after.<br><br>The Ekiti State Police Public relations officer (PPRO) ASP Sunday Abutu and State Commandant of Amotekun Corps, Brigadier General Joe Komolafe (rtd) in separate interviews said his release was secured at Obbo Ayegunle, Ekiti Local Government Area, Kwara State. However, they neither confirmed nor denied that any ransom was paid.<br><br>In April 2020, then Commissioner of Information and Values Orientation, Muyiwa Olumiluwa, announced the release of his counterpart in the Ministry of Agriculture, Olabode Folorunso, was released unhurt after he was kidnapped. Also, he did not mention that the state government paid the N15 million the abductors of Folorunso demanded, but stressed that government would do all possible to “rid the state of criminal elements.”<br><br>A Chinese and one of the contractors the state government engaged to construct the new Ado Ekiti- Iyin – Ekiti road was also abducted late last year. The gunmen killed one of the policemen attached to the contractors, while the victim was released four days at Ilawe – Ekiti road after payment of N100m ransom. Families of victims in Ondo State were always eager to secure the release of their loved ones whenever they were kidnapped. Sunday Telegraph’s findings revealed that over N14m was paid as ransom between December 2020 and May this year. In January, this year, a 35-yearold man, Olatunbosun Johnson, was abducted within Uso Community in Owo Local Government Area.<br><br>After spending one week in the kidnappers’ den, he regained his freedom, but not without his family parting with the sum of N10 million. Also, a couple who were kidnapped on their way from Ebonyi got their freedom after the payment of N2million ransom. The couple, Mr. and Mrs. Gbenga Ibikunle, was kidnapped at Uso along Owo- Akure highway.<br><br>Similarly, two reverend sisters, Perpetual Idowu Apo and Bukola Roseline Familade alongside their driver Yohanna Zibai, who were kidnapped at Onipetesi axis of Ondo State along Benin-Ore-Lagos expressway, paid N1m to secure their freedom.<br><br>The victims were held hostage for 11 days in the bush, until the ransom was paid to the secure their release. Oyo State is a hot bed of kidnapping, especially the Okeho in the northern part of the state. On April 24, 2021, some unknown gunmen kidnapped a hotelier, Olukunle Oyedokun, and his nursing wife, Juliana, at their hotel in Ajaawa, Ogo Oluwa Local Government Area of the state. The sum of N15m ransom was demanded by the kidnappers who got a sum of N2.5million upon negotiation.<br><br>On Sunday May 23, 2021, wife of the Oyo State All Progressives Congress (APC) youth leader, (Mogaji Isiaka Ajibola Areokuta), Dr. Mrs Arikeade Oni-Salawu, was also kidnapped by some gunmen. She was kidnapped in front of her residence while she was driving and her husband was driving behind. As she got down to open their gate, the kidnappers who had lurked around, swooped on her and whisked her away. In Kogi State, there were not many cases of kidnap this year except the recent abduction of Yagba West Local Government Chairman, Mr. Pius Kolawole that led to the killing of Commissioner, Kogi state pension board. Though he had since reunited with his family, Sunday Telegraph learnt that the kidnappers had demanded for N50 million ransom. It was not certain if the sum was paid before his release.</blockquote><br><a href="https://www.newtelegraphng.com/kidnappers-bandits-rake-in-n20bn-in-500-attacks-investigation/">https://www.newtelegraphng.com/kidnappers-bandits-rake-in-n20bn-in-500-attacks-investigation/</a></div><p class="s"> (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/newpost?topic=6715248&amp;post=105083454">Quote</a>)  (<a href="https://www.nairaland.com/makereport?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105083454&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105083454">Report</a>)  <b id="lpt105083454">1 Like </b> (<a id="lpl105083454" onclick="like(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105083454&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105083454&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unlikepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105083454&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105083454&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;lpt105083454&#39;, &#39;lpl105083454&#39;); return false;" href="https://www.nairaland.com/do_likepost?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105083454&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105083454">Like</a>)<b id="shb105083454"> 1 Share</b> (<a id="sh105083454" onclick="share(&#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_share?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105083454&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105083454&#39;, &#39;https://www.nairaland.com/do_unshare?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105083454&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105083454&#39;, &#39;sh105083454&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;shb105083454&#39;); return false;" href="https://www.nairaland.com/do_share?session=AB302BD919D6DD8AEA0FEF8790C1B743A80AE3FDD75CB322CD8610A817837CDC&amp;post=105083454&amp;redirect=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgreenfield%26search%3DSearch%23105083454">Share</a>)</p><p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="./Search_files/14089613_kadunabanditsgunmen_jpeg196b50b433beb8980e23d02858444935"> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="104967719"></a><a name="msg104967719"></a><a name="6710294.0"></a><img src="./Search_files/xx.gif">  <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/business">Business</a> / <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/6710294/kyari-tasks-nnpc-greenfield-refinery#104967719">Kyari Tasks NNPC Greenfield Refinery Ltd Board On Fuel Importation</a> by <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/themomentng" class="user">themomentng</a>: <span class="s"><b>6:27pm</b> On <b>Aug 19</b></span></td></tr><tr><td id="pb104967719" class="l w pd"><div class="narrow">The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has charged members of the Board of the NNPC <span class="highlight">greenfield</span> Refinery Limited (NGRL), to explore all available options to bring an end to the current challenge of petroleum products importation.<br><br>Mallam Kyari gave the charge on Thursday while inaugurating the Board of the newly incorporated subsidiary of the Corporation, NNPC <span class="highlight">greenfield</span> Refinery Limited (NGRL), at the NNPC Towers, Abuja.<br><br>The NNPC <span class="highlight">greenfield</span> Refinery Limited is a subsidiary of the Corporation set up in December 2020 with a mandate to oversee the establishment and operation of new refineries.<br><br>The GMD, who is also the Chairman of the NGRL Board, challenged members of the Board to focus on profitability in order to remain afloat and avoid liquidation.<br><br>“As a business, this is a big opportunity for us and this company’s balance sheet must change positively.
