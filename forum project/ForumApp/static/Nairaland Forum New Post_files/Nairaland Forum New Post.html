Registrar thicken.<br><br>In the wake of the aftermath of Oprah Winfrey Oscars #metoo campaign, earlier this year on Jan. 8th, 2018, a Unilag Alumnae by name, Aigbeme Okonkwo shared on her FBook, how 12years ago, her academic course adviser, then Dr. Louis Egwari sexually harassed &amp; intimidated her. <br><br>She stated out of deep concern that Egwari is now a faculty at CU &amp; feared he might be a similar sexual predator to the female students. <br><br>Eight months after her FB post, CU fires Prof Egwari who was caught pants down live and right in his office with a married female staff who just returned from Maternity leave. Unknown to him the School's MGT had put him under surveillance, wired his office with a secret CCTV. <br>Both of them have since been fired. <br><br>Egwari rose to the position of a Professor in the BioSci Dept. in 2010/11 and he is said to have to his credit about two Patents for his research innovations: Pawpaw Tea (a.k.a Pawka) &amp; Grounded Rice Meal.<br>He was also one of the several CU's faculty, ordained by Bishop Oyedepo to serve as associate pastors at his church, faith tabernacle.<br><br>His sack came some days ago, ahead of the current ongoing sexual allegations against the Registrar &amp; school at the moment. <br><br>It's really sad that some of the people that Bishop Oyedepo has appointed to help him run his divine assignment and vision are apparently wolves in sheep's clothing. <br><br>It was also reported that it is on record that, a popular Fmr. Chaplain @ Covenant University, who is still one of Oyedepo's key pastors and board members till date, impregnated his house maid (who has been on the run for fear for her safety), but shockingly till date, the said pastor still officiates at Winners sunday services, he usually seats next to Oyedepo's wife, Pastor Faith every Sunday @ the Tabernacle, Ota.<br><br>We only hope Oyedepo will take necessary actions before these wolves run down his entire ministry for him.  Enough said!</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td class=" l"><a name="71233649"></a><a href="https://www.nairaland.com/4732571/covenant-university-sex-scandal-photos/5#71233649" title="September 15, 2018 at 08:46:37 PM">164</a>. <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/zinaunreal" class="user">zinaunreal</a>(<span class="m">m</span>):

Is a federal school or state also a brothel?? Do people just have sex indiscriminately? Sharap your god forsaken mouth. If the crown price of saudi arabia understands how humans behave thereby easing strict rules on a very religious kingdom he rules how much more a petty hypocritical school in Nigeria. <br><br>These people know that if you dont adjust and ease, rebels must surely present themselves thereby causing further harm to their religion. Change is constant.<br><br>Example: A religious body like the catholic church has one of the highest rate of pedophilia and sex offenses despite their nasty rules. Rules are rules right??<br>They cant even control priests, how much more adventurous teenage students. Drugs are even sold in these schools like its normal, and because these students feel they are in prison, drugs are very very valueable as valueable as getting a first class<br><br>In so far as you try to control the basic human behaviour you will always loose!! This is just the beginning<br><br>You need basic guide on history and psychology before you argue like a puppet of religion. Go and service your brain</blockquote><br>You now see why you need to have your head examined? Since nobody has had the boldness to tell you, I will do you the favour. Go and check your head before it gets too late! See how you're barking sharap! Shut your mouth, etc.......listen to yourself. Do you sound normal?<br><br>If you were ok, you would not need anybody to tell you that the fact that everyone knows that some people would break the law is NO EXCUSE TO NOT HAVE LAWS! <br><br>THE FACT THAT WE KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL TAKE WHAT DOES NOT BELONG TO THEM DOES NOT MEAN THE SOCIETY SHOULD REMOVE LAWS AGAINST STEALING, RATHER THAT IS THE REASON THERE IS PRISON OR OTHER FORMS OF PUNISHMENT!! I will only tell you one last time; if you can't adhere to the laws upheld by an institution, get out of there!

This time, an audio of the male Covenant University who took the institution to court and won has been released and it shows him admitting to being guilty of all the school accused him of.<br><br>Adooh Emmanuel claimed he was framed by Covenant University, CU, (read here) with the help of Omotayo Dada and Marilyn Effanga. He said the University claimed he had sex with one of the girls and as a result, they expelled him just before graduation, after he had spent 5 years in the institution. He went on to claim he was innocent and was a guy who kept all the rules of the institution and never had time for Covenant University girls.<br><br>He eventually took the University to court and emerged victorious. Afterwards, he took to Twitter to call out CU and the two ladies involved. He claimed Omotayo and Marilyn helped the school frame him up.<br><br>He later deleted his threat after Omotayo warned him to delete it because they are lies.<br><br>But Omotayo and Marilyn came out with their side of the story after Omotayo and her family began receiving threats (read here). Both Omotayo and Marilyn said Adooh had sex with Marilyn and later accused her of giving him an STI. But tests proved she was negative for any STI. The university later saw the messages on both women's mobile devices and invited them for questioning. They said Adooh begged them to cover up for him, which they tried to do, but they were threatened with expulsion and they eventually said the truth. This led to Adooh's expulsion.<br><br>They also revealed that they have an audio of Adooh admitting to this without knowing he was being recorded.<br><br>The audio has now been released. In it, Emmanuel is heard narrating to a friend that he indeed had sex with Marilyn and went to bed immediately afterwards. As a result, his ejaculate stuck to his skin and also to his boxers. When he woke at night to ease himself, his briefs had already stuck to his male member due to his discharge. This made him bleed when removing the underwear and he thought Marilyn had given him an STI.<br><br>He admitted to calling Marilyn to accuse her of infecting him in Dec 2017. He also said he called her friend Omotayo to complain. He said he later discovered it wasn't an STI but it was his underwear sticking to his skin due to the dried discharge.<br><br>He further revealed that this year Marilyn got into trouble with the school and they saw the messages on her phone and also on Omotayo's phone so the school's SDC invited him for questioning as regards sexual immorality. He said when they showed him the chats and his photo, he denied being the Adooh in the chats and kept denying it all through. The school then called Omotayo to testify against him.<br><br>Adooh is then heard in the audio calling Omotayo names, saying:<br><br>So they come call that Tayo, that ugly bitch, that bastard, that swine...<br><br>Listen to the audio <a href="https://newsprex.com/discussion/354/convenant-university-scandal-leaked-audio-shows-expelled-male-student-admits-to-being-guilty"><b>HERE</b></a>.</blockquote><br>What do you expect from them, this is same thing there parents do in high places</td></tr><tr><td class=" l"><a name="71188752"></a><a href="https://www.nairaland.com/4732571/covenant-university-sex-scandal-photos/4#71188752" title="September 14, 2018 at 10:57:20 AM">138</a>. <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/salford1" class="user">salford1</a>:
